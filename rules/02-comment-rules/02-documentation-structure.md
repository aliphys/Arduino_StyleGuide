# Rules
- Documentation Structure:
  - Each Arduino library should have a README.md in the main folder, introducing the library.
  - A docs folder should contain detailed documentation, including an assets folder for images and other assets, and an api.md file for class and function documentation.
  - The docs/README.md provides an overview of library features and usage.
- Formatting
  - Inline Comments: Use /// for documenting single lines of code inside functions or blocks.
  - Member Documentation: Document members on the same line using ///<.
- Markup for API Documentation
  - @author: Denotes the author.
  - @param: Documents parameters and their direction ([in], [out], [in,out]).
  - @return: Describes what value and type is returned.
  - @see: Refers to related documentation.
  - @code example @endcode: Provides usage examples.
  - Backticks ( ): Use for code references.
  - @note: Highlights extra notes.
  - @brief: Differentiates between brief and detailed explanations.
  - @since: Indicates version introduction.
  - @deprecated: Marks deprecated functions or classes.
  - Use <p> for paragraphs and <a href="..."> for hyperlinks.
- Ordering Multiple Tags
  - Follow a specific order for tags: @author, @note, @param, @return, @see, @since, @deprecated.
  - List multiple @author tags in chronological order and multiple @param tags in argument-declaration order.
