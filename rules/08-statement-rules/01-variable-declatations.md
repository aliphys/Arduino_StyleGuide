# Rules
- Do not use the comma operator in variable declarations.  

# Examples
## Good example
```
char x = "c"; 
char y = "";  
```

## Bad example
```
char x = "c", y = "";
```

# Reasoning
- Placing each declaration on its own line enhances readability and reduces the risk of misunderstandings or errors
